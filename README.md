# disease-diagnosis-and-prediction-model
This project builds a machine learning-based diagnostic tool that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data. It uses classical ML algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, trained on a clinical dataset, and is ideal for early detection and health decision support.
